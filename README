*FATSHEET*

A GPU-accelerated spreadsheet compiler.

Fatsheet extracts cell contents from xml spreadsheets, analyzes dependencies, 
then compiles cell equations into GPU kernels.  Uses EPD 2.6.5 and PyCUDA.

Future:
-- add support for other spreadsheet formats
-- add openCL support
-- requirements.txt would be nice
-- performance test using better sample spreadsheets
-- xml content handler needs to handle repeated values nicely
-- need better device queries
